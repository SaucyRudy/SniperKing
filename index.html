    <p>Sniper King, also known as God Ussop. The man with an armada made of over 3000 men. Ussop is the sniper of a Yonko level crew. He is currently one of the 9 commanders in the Straw Hat crew. Ussop has the 6th highest bounty in the crew at $500,000,000 berries(dollars). Since he is one of the commanders he does actually command the Straw Hat fleet along with the other commanders that consist of 6 captains and over 5,200 troops. His goal in his journey is to become a brave warrior of the sea.</p>

    <p>Ussop since a very young age has been known to be a liar. So much infact that he was given the nickname "big nose liar". He would always lie about pirates coming to invade his islands home town of Syrup village. Ussop did this out of hope that one day it would come true. This was due to the fact that his mother was extremely ill when he was at a young age. His dad Yassop had left him the moment Ussops mother got ill. Yassop left to join the Red Hair pirates and help Red Hair Shanks, current Yonko with a bounty over 4 billion berries. Ussop lost his mother but this did not stop him from continuing to torture the village with his lies.</p>

    <p>Fortunately for Ussop a group of young pirates did arrive to his village. However, it was not the Red Hair Pirates but the Straw Hat Pirates. Ussop soon then got invited to join the crew for his sniping skills, his will to become stronger, and his desire to one day find his father. Ussops bounties consisted of 30 million where he was referred to as Sogeking(sniper king in japanese), 200 million where he was referred to as God Ussop, and lastly now 500 million known as God Sniper King Ussop. Ofcourse in reality Ussop is your average male human that doe snot posses any abnormal or superhuman abilities. He is simply a sniper on a crew and plays his role very well. He is a support member who makes sure everyone is where they need to be and assist whoever needs it from a distance.</p>
