    <p>The Sniper King, also known as God Ussop. The man with an armada made of over 8000 men. Ussop is the sniper of a Yonko level crew. He is currently one of the 9 commanders in the Straw Hat crew. Ussop has the 6th highest bounty in the crew at $500,000,000 berries. Since he is one of the commanders he does actually command the Straw Hat fleet along with the other commanders that consist of 6 captains and over 5,200 troops. His goal in his journey is to become a brave warrior of the sea. Fortunately for Ussop a group of young pirates arrived to his village, the Straw Hats. Ussop soon then got invited to join the crew for his sniping skills, his will to become stronger, and his desire to one day find his father. Ussops bounties consisted of 30 million where he was referred to as Sogeking, 200 million where he was referred to as God Ussop, and lastly now 500 million known as God Sniper King Ussop. Ussop is your average male human that does not posses any abnormal or superhuman abilities. He is simply a sniper on a crew and plays his role very well. He is a support member who makes sure everyone is where they need to be and assist whoever needs it from a distance.</p>
