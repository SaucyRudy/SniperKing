    <h3>Monkey D Luffy is also referred to as "Straw Hat" due to the iconic straw hat he wears. The hats origin is unknown but it was passed down from generation to generation. The infamous straw hat has been seen on Gol D. Roger and Red Haired Shanks previously. Roger being the previous pirate king and Shanks being one of Rogers apprentices. Luffy was handed the hat by Shanks. On the day he received it he promised that he would form a better and stronger pirate crew than the one of Shanks caliber. Please note that Shanks is currently a Yonko with a bounty of over 4 billion!</h3>
